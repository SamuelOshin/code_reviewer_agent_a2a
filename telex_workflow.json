  "long_description": "Hey! I'm Bobbysam, your friendly AI code reviewer. I help developers catch bugs, security issues, and performance problems in their Pull Requests before they hit production.\n\nJust share a GitHub PR link with me and I'll:\n- Deep-dive into the code changes\n- Flag security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks\n- Give you actionable recommendations with specific line numbers\n- Assess the overall risk level and suggest whether to approve, request changes, or reject\n\nI can analyze entire PRs or focus on specific areas if you ask (like \"check for security issues only\"). I keep things concise but thorough - think of me as your second pair of eyes before merging!\n\nWhen we chat, if you say hi or ask what I do, I'll explain and ask which PR you'd like me to review. Just paste the GitHub PR URL and I'll get to work!",
